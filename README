List/Priority version 0.01
==========================

NAME
    List::Priority - Perl extension for a list that manipulates objects by
    their priority

SYNOPSIS
      use List::Priority;
  
      # Create an instance
      $list = List::Priority->new();
  
      # Insert some elements, each woth a unique priority
      $list->insert(2,'World!');
      $list->insert(5,'Hello');
      $list->insert(3,' ');
  
      # Print
      while ($list->pop()) {
              print $_;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    If you want to handle multiple data bits by their order of importance -
    This one's for you.

    Logic: Precedence to highest priority object. If more than one object
    hold the highest priority - FIFO is king.

    Duplicate objects are currently not allowed.

    I'd like to thank Joseph N. Hall and Randal L. Schwartz for their
    excellent book "Effective Perl Programming" for one of the code hacks...
